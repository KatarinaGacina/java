# Selected Topics in Software Development 1

These laboratory assigements were completed as part of the Selected Topics in Software Development 1 course at college.

The laboratory assigements are implemented in **Java**.
Code is commented and has Junit tests and demo classes.


## First laboratory assigement: 
Implementation of resizable array-backed collection of objects - ArrayIndexedCollection  
Implementation of linked list-backed collection of objects - LinkedListIndexedCollection

Stack implementation as instance of an ArrayIndexedCollection - ObjectStack  
Demonstration by running: 
`java -cp . hr.fer.oprpp1.custom.collections.demo.StackDemo "8 -2 / -1 *"`

## Second laboratory assigement: 
Improvements of previously implemented collections.  
Development of a simple language processor.

## Third laboratory assigement: 
Parametrization of previously implemented collections.  
Dictionary implementation.  
Implementation of a hash table with open addressing that allows storage of key-value pairs.

## Fourth laboratory assigement: 
A simple database emulator implementation.

## Fifth laboratory assigement: 
Implementation of functionality to encrypt and decrypt files using the AES algorithm with a 128-bit key, as well as to compute and verify SHA-256 file digests.  
Implementation of command-line program (MyShell).

## Sixth laboratory assigement: 
Implemented a lightweight mathematical library with support for operations on complex numbers and polynomials.  
Generation of fractal images using the Newton-Raphson iteration applied to complex polynomials.

## Seventh laboratory assigement: 
Implementation of layout managers.  
Calculator implementation.  
Bar chart implementation.

## Eighth laboratory assigement: 
Implementation of text file editor.
