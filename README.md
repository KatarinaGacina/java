# Selected Topics in Software Development 1

These laboratory assigements were completed as part of the *Selected Topics in Software Development 1* course at college. The laboratory assigements are implemented in Java.

**First laboratory assigement**: Implementation of resizable array-backed collection of objects (ArrayIndexedCollection) and an implementation of linked list-backed collection of objects (LinkedListIndexedCollection).

**Second laboratory assigement**: Improvements of previously implemented collections. Development of a simple language processor.

**Third laboratory assigement**: Parametrization of previously implemented collections. Dictionary implementation. Implementation of a hash table with open addressing that allows storage of key-value pairs.

**Fourth laboratory assigement**: A simple database emulator implementation.

**Fifth laboratory assigement**: Implementation of functionality to encrypt and decrypt files using the AES algorithm with a 128-bit key, as well as to compute and verify SHA-256 file digests. Implementation of command-line program (MyShell).

**Sixth laboratory assigement**: Implemented a lightweight mathematical library with support for operations on complex numbers and polynomials. Generation of fractal images using the Newton-Raphson iteration applied to complex polynomials.

**Seventh laboratory assigement**: Implementation of layout managers. Calculator implementation. Bar chart implementation.

**Eighth laboratory assigement**: Implementation of text file editor.
